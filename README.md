# Conviso Platform Public Roadmap
### Explore the Conviso Platform Public Product Roadmap üßë‚ÄçüöÄ

Our product roadmap provides insights into the features we are developing, their current stages, and our expected delivery timelines. Have any questions or feedback about the roadmap? Share your thoughts via the Conviso Platform support channel.

The roadmap repository is designed to communicate the strategic direction of Conviso Platform. While existing issues are currently read-only, we are actively engaging with customers to gather feedback and improve. Interaction limits are in place to ensure that all contributions are relevant and constructive. We are committed to refining the format of the roadmap and fostering more meaningful discussions about the future of our products and features. If you have feedback on how the issues are presented, please share it through our support channel in the Conviso Platform.

## Guide to the Roadmap üìë
Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:
- **A release phase** that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases.
  
- **A feature area** that indicates the area of the product to which the item belongs. For a list of current product areas, see below.

- **A feature** that indicates the feature or product to which the item belongs. For a list of current features, see below.

<!-- - **One or more product SKU labels** that indicate which product SKUs we expect the feature to be available in. For a list of current product SKUs, see below. -->

Once a feature is delivered, the shipped label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed with a comment linking to the relevant Changelog post.

## Release Phases üö¶
Release phases indicate the stages that the product or feature goes through, from early testing to general availability.

- **preview:** Publicly available in full or limited capacity. Features mostly complete and documented. Timeline and requirements for GA usually published. No SLAs or support provided.

- **ga:** Generally available to all customers. Ready for production use with associated SLA and technical support obligations. Approximately 1-2 quarters from Preview.

Some of our features may still be in the exploratory stages, and have no timeframe available. These are included in the roadmap only for early feedback. These are marked as follows:

- **in design:** Feature or improvment in discovery phase. We have decided to build, but are still figuring out how.

- **exploring:** Feature or improvment under consideration. We are considering building, and gathering feedback on it.

## Roadmap Stages üõ£Ô∏è
The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every product or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship next. Be sure to read the disclaimer below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline. You'll also find an Exploratory column, which is used in conjunction with the in design and exploring release phase labels for when no timeframe is yet available.
